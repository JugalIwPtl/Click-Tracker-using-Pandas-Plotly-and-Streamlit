## Overview

This project aims to track user interactions and visualize click data using Plotly, an open-source Python library for creating graphical plots. By recording clicks on an HTML interface and analyzing the data, we can gain insights into user behavior and product demand. This project leverages Pandas for extracting the data collected from clicks and making it suitable for the Plotly to process.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
The Plotly library performs the data visualisation of the click_data.json file.

## Load Data using pandas:
Reads the click data from click_data.json.

## Data Processing:
Converts timestamps to datetime objects and aggregates click data by date and button.

## Visualization:
### Line Chart: Shows the number of clicks per day.
### Scatter Plot: Displays the number of clicks per button.
### Heatmap: Visualizes the distribution of clicks across buttons.

## Importance of Data Science in Business
Data science plays a crucial role in helping businesses understand user behavior and improve their conversion rates. By tracking clicks and interactions, businesses can:
### Identify popular products and features.
### Optimize user experience based on interaction patterns.
### Make data-driven decisions to increase sales and engagement.
### This project showcases the power of data analysis and visualization in uncovering valuable insights that can drive business growth.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the necessity of data science in modern businesses. By tracking and analyzing user interactions, businesses can gain actionable insights that lead to better decision-making and improved conversion rates. This project serves as a simple yet powerful example of how data science can be applied to real-world scenarios.
